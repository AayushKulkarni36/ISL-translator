#  ISL Voice-to-Sign Language Translator 

A project that translates spoken English into Indian Sign Language (ISL) using **Speech Recognition**, **NLP**, and **3D animated sign videos**. This helps bridge the communication gap for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community in India.

---

##  Features

-  **Speech-to-Text** using Python's `speech_recognition` library.
-  **Text Simplification** using basic NLP techniques.
-  **Word-to-Sign Mapping** powered by a custom ISL dictionary.
-  **3D ISL Sign Display** using `OpenCV` to show animated sign videos.
-  **Web UI** for accessible user interaction.
